# Fast-Scheduling-Algorithm-for-Total-Earliness-and-Tardiness
I developed a fully polynomial-time optimal algorithm to transform a given sequence, the permutation of jobs, into its corresponding minimum cost schedule, the timing of jobs. This is my first attempt to schedule tasks on a single machine to minimize the total earliness plus total tardiness.
