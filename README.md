# Fast-Scheduling-Algorithm-for-Total-Earliness-and-Tardiness
I developed a fully polynomial-time optimal algorithm to transform a given sequence, the permutation of jobs, into its corresponding minimum cost schedule, the timing of jobs. This is my first attempt to schedule tasks on a single machine to minimize the total earliness plus total tardiness.

This notebook is part of the research based on paper _Migration from Sequence to Schedule in Total Earliness and Tardiness Scheduling Problem_. ([here](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2019/07/7280.html)).

> This notebook runs on Python 2.
